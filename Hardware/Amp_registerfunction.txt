Amplifier use
======================
register 01H of de speaker channels are enabled
register 02H set the wanted attacktime(= the minimum time beween gain decreases), Default = 6.4ms/6dB ==> bits 5 to 0
register 03H Set the release time for AGC (automate gain control), release time= minimum time between gain increases ==> bits 5 to 0
register 04H --> hold time = minimum time between a gain decrease and a gain increase, can be deactivated
register 05H --> fixed gain control, Select the fixed gain of the amplifier, if compression enbled (-28dB to 30dB) if compression disabled (0dB to 30dB)
register 06H --> AGC control en/disable output limiter, noisegate threshold level, output limiter level
rrgister 07H --> Set compression ratio and max gain (30 dB to use the AGC to the max)
